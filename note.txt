Imperfection(s):

1. Plane ID limited to 7 characters [XX 1111] (8 including null terminator)
2. lacking in checking which runaway is less contented (due to misread of questions)
3. function enqueue (aka sorting linked list into run0/run1) halted, due to lack of knowledge in sorting linked list
4. function decrement & function check needed to be revised since it's conflicting between fuel and range
5. function increment becomes redundant since queueing time isnt really used
6. Planes cannot be the same time or name, else, first come first served basis.
